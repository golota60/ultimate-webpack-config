## Ultimate webpack setup

This is the entry point for bootstrapping all my react applications. I always swap a few things, depending on which tooling I want to use, but generally it all comes down to modifying this repo. I try to keep this up to date.

If you want to use it too, here are the things that it uses:
- [SASS](https://github.com/sass/sass)
- [Linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria)
- [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
- [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/)
- [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
- [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)

This is state manager agnostic. You need to add it yourself.
